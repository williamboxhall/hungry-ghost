# **Hungry Ghost**

**Hungry Ghost** is a game of karma, reincarnation, and enlightenment. Players traverse multiple lives to purify themselves of Delusion and gain Insight.

### **Objective**

To achieve Nirvana 🪷 and break the cycle of Samsara. A player wins immediately if they **die while having 7 Insight 🪷**.

## **The Board & Stats**

Each player tracks the following on their board:

* **Merit ☯️:** Karmic balance (-5 to +5). Starts at 0. Gained through Good Deeds and lost through Bad Deeds. Carries over through reincarnations.
* **Life ❤️:** Hearts remaining on the aging track. Your head 👤 starts at position 0 and moves through positions 1-5, removing ❤️ along the way. When all ❤️ are gone, you must either extend life with Dana 🌕 or die. Resets to 5 when reincarnating in the Human Realm, otherwise bound to ☯️ in spiritual realms.
* **Dana 🌕:** Currency / material resource used to perform Good Deeds or extend survival on the aging track. Resets to 0 upon death.
* **Delusion ☁️:** Obscurations to clarity. Starts at 30 (maximum). Must be reduced to 0 before Insight can be gained. Increases in Hell and decreases in Heaven, but cannot exceed the starting maximum of 30. Carries over through reincarnations.
* **Insight 🪷:** Spiritual understanding. Gained only after ☁️ is cleared. Resets to 0 upon death.

### **Locations (Human Realm)**

* **Mountain Cave ⛰️:** Solitary meditation (High efficiency).
* **Forest 🌲:** Nature meditation (Medium efficiency).
* **Town 🏘️:** Social hub for Alms and Deeds.
* **Temple ⛩️:** Group meditation and Ordination (becoming ordained as a Monk 🥣).

## **Turn Structure**

A turn in the Human Realm consists of three phases: **Morning 🌅**, **Afternoon ☀️**, and **Evening 🌙**.

### **1. Morning 🌅 & Afternoon ☀️ (Action Phases)**

In each of these two phases, the active player performs **one** voluntary action:

* **Move 🚶:** Travel to an adjacent location.
* **Meditate 🧘:** (Requires **Meditator** status). Reduces ☁️ or gains 🪷 (if ☁️ is 0).
  * *⛩️:* -1 ☁️ (additional -1 per other player present).
  * *🌲:* -1 ☁️.
  * *⛰️:* -2 ☁️.
* **Good Deed 😇:** Pay **1 🌕** to gain **+1 ☯️**.
  * *Restriction:* Must be in 🏘️ or sharing a location with another player.
  * *Effect:* If in 🏘️, 🌕 goes to the town hall (game box). If with players, the 🌕 goes to a player.
* **Bad Deed 😈:** Lose **☯️ equal to 🌕 stolen**.
  * *Restriction:* Must be in 🏘️ or sharing a location with another player.
  * *Effect:* Steal 1 🌕 from *every* other player at your location. If in 🏘️, steal an additional +1 🌕 from the town hall (game box). Lose 1 ☯️ for each 🌕 stolen.
* **Alms 🙏:** (Requires **Monk 🥣** status). Gain **+1 🌕** from the town.
  * *Restriction:* Morning 🌅 phase only. Must be in 🏘️.
* **Skip ⏭️:** Pass the time and proceed to the next phase.

### **2. Evening 🌙 (Maturation)**

The day ends and the active player matures by choosing one of these options:

* **Age 👤→❤️:** If there is a ❤️ to the right of your 👤 position, you must remove it and move your 👤 into that position.

* **Extend 👤→🌕:** If there is a 🌕 to the right of your 👤 position, you may spend 1 🌕 to remove the 🌕 and move your 👤 into that position.

* **Die 💀🔄:** If there is no ❤️ or 🌕 to the right of your 👤 position, or if you choose not to extend, you must die and proceed to the Death & Reincarnation phase.

* **Nirvana 🪷:** If there is no ❤️ to the right of your 👤 position, and you have 7 🪷, you may choose to enter Nirvana and win the game immediately. If you have 🌕 available, you may also choose to extend instead.

* **Bodhisattva 🧘🔄:** If there is no ❤️ to the right of your 👤 position, and you have 7 🪷, you may choose to become a Bodhisattva, foregoing immediate Nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment. Reincarnate in the Human Realm as a Teacher 👨‍🏫, keeping your current ☯️. This is simply a compassionate choice - any player who later achieves 7 🪷 can still win by choosing Nirvana.

*Note: The aging track represents your journey through life. You start at position 0 with ❤️ waiting at positions 1-5. 🌕 can extend survival but only after all ❤️ are removed.*

## **Player States & Passive Effects**

* **Monk 🥣:** Gained by ordaining at the ⛩️. Allows the **Alms 🙏** action.
* **Meditator 🧘‍♀️:** Prerequisite for Meditating. Learned automatically if you end a move in the same location as a **Teacher 👨‍🏫**.
* **Teacher 👨‍🏫:** (Reincarnated from Heaven).
  * **Compulsion:** Automatically teaches players when entering the ⛩️ or when other players enter the Teacher's location. Only teaches players who are not already **Meditators 🧘‍♀️**. Gains **+1 ☯️** per player taught.
* **Greedy 👹:** (Reincarnated from Hell).
  * **Compulsion:** Automatically performs a Bad Deed when entering 🏘️ or when other players enter the Greedy's location. Only steals from players/Town that have 🌕 available. Always steals from Town (which acts as an NPC with unlimited 🌕).

## **Spiritual Realms**

Players in spiritual realms follow a two-phase turn structure similar to the Human Realm.

**Player Board Changes:** In spiritual realms, the ❤️/🌕 track is out of play and ❤️ is instead represented by colored hearts placed directly on the ☯️ slider. ❤️appear between 1 and your karma position in Heaven, and between -1 and your karma position in Heaven. As ☯️ moves towards zero, ❤️ are removed accordingly. 🌕 plays no role in spiritual realms.

### **Heaven Realm 🪽**

* **Entry Condition:** Die with **Positive (+) ☯️**.
* **Status:** You exist in bliss. Take on Teacher 👨‍🏫 status, ❤️ fills positions +1 to +☯️ value.
* **Morning 🌅 Action - Bliss:** -1 ☁️ (minimum 0).
* **Evening 🌙 Action:**
  * **Age:** If ❤️ remains (☯️ > 0), -1 ☯️ and lose 1 ❤️.
  * **Die:** If no ❤️ remain (☯️ = 0), reincarnate in the Human Realm as a **Teacher 👨‍🏫**.

### **Hell Realm 🔥**

* **Entry Condition:** Die with **Negative (-) ☯️**.
* **Status:** You exist in suffering. Take on Greedy 👹 status, ❤️ fills positions -1 to -|☯️| value.
* **Morning 🌅 Action - Agony:** +1 ☁️ (maximum 30).
* **Evening 🌙 Action:**
  * **Age:** If ❤️ remains (☯️ < 0), +1 ☯️ toward 0 and lose 1 ❤️.
  * **Die:** If no ❤️ remain (☯️ = 0), reincarnate in the Human Realm as **Greedy 👹**.

## **Death & Reincarnation 💀🔄**

When a player dies in the Human Realm:

**Judge ☯️:**
    * **Positive:** Immediately reincarnate in **Heaven 🪽**. 🌕 and 🪷 are lost, ❤️ fills positions +1 up to your ☯️ value (health = Merit). ☁️ remains unchanged.
    * **Negative:** Immediately reincarnate in **Hell 🔥**. 🌕 and 🪷 are lost, ❤️ fills positions -1 down to your ☯️ value (health = |Merit|). ☁️ remains unchanged.
    * **Zero:** Immediately reincarnate in **Human Realm** (🏘️). 🌕 and 🪷 are lost, ❤️ resets to 5 hearts, ☁️ remains unchanged.
